"""Mixin for lazy-loading sub-SDKs via a _sub_sdk_map dict.

Sub-SDK aggregator classes (FootballStatsSDK, StatsSDK, GriddyNFL) all need
the same pattern: a ``_sub_sdk_map`` dict mapping attribute names to
``(module_path, class_name)`` tuples, with ``__getattr__`` that dynamically
imports and caches sub-SDK instances on first access.

This mixin provides that behaviour so each class only needs to define its
``_sub_sdk_map``.

class LazySubSDKMixin:
    """Mixin that enables lazy-loading of sub-SDKs from ``_sub_sdk_map``.

    On first attribute access, the mixin dynamically imports the sub-SDK
    module, instantiates the class with the parent's ``sdk_configuration``
    and ``parent_ref``, and caches the instance via ``setattr`` so that
    subsequent accesses return the same object without re-importing.

    The ``__dir__`` override ensures sub-SDK names appear in
    ``dir()`` and IDE autocompletion even before they are instantiated.

    Requirements for using this mixin:

    1. Define a class-level ``_sub_sdk_map`` dict mapping attribute names
       to ``(module_path, class_name)`` tuples.
    2. Ensure the class has ``sdk_configuration`` and ``parent_ref``
       attributes (typically inherited from ``BaseSDK``).
    3. Each sub-SDK class referenced in ``_sub_sdk_map`` must accept
       ``(sdk_configuration, *, parent_ref)`` as its constructor signature.

    Example::

        class MySDK(LazySubSDKMixin, BaseSDK):
            _sub_sdk_map: Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]] = {
                "games": (
                    "griddy.nfl.endpoints.regular.football.games",
                    "Games",
                ),
            }

        sdk = MySDK(config)
        sdk.games  # first access: imports module, instantiates Games, caches it
        sdk.games  # subsequent access: returns cached instance

        """Lazily import, instantiate, and cache a sub-SDK on first access.
