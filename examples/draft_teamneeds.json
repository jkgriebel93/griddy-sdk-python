The signings of RB Najee Harris and WR Mike Williams are not nearly enough. On defense, the Bolts should be looking to add competition on the interior and off the edge.

Defensive tackle is the leanest of the areas of need, but the matter of finding an heir apparent to Trent Williams, who is heading into his age-37 season, demands attention -- as does the edge-rusher spot opposite Nick Bosa. Running back depth shouldn’t be overlooked, given the way injuries chewed through the position during a disappointing 2024 season for San Francisco. -- by Dan Parr",
