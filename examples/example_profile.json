    "overview": "<p>Inside linebacker with solid production and an average athletic profile. Smith looks faster on tape than his timed speed would suggest. He can disrupt the action with called blitzes and shots downhill. However, his instincts and play recognition are lacking. Smith plays with a competitive demeanor, but he needs to ratchet up his physicality as a tackler. He\u2019s capable on special teams, but he might not stand out enough to give himself much of a chance to make a roster.</p>",
